# Database Schema

> Documents the database format of the API. Collections, documents, and fields can be accessed directly using the [Firestore API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/) with a ruleset. Note that the use of Firestore does not replace all application functionality but to provide getter methods for data in an efficient way.
